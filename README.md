Coming from a Java background, Python always seemed interesting and unique to me. 
This repository is my way of keeping track of everything I learn in Python and will hold me accountable for the progress I make.

All files in this repository belong to Swastik Satapathy and if any code used/referenced within the files is the work of another individual being, they will be properly credited
